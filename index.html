			<h4>Who am I?</h4>
			<p>I am a thirtysomething software developer currently located in Toronto, Canada.
			<p>I was born in Panaji, India, and clocked a little bit of time in Saudi Arabia and Austria before rooting myself in the land of Maple Syrup and the Tragically Hip.</p>
			<p>In 2008 I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Computer Science degree and Philosophy minor. I was an active member (and once-President) of the university's Computer Science Club while I was there, arranging visiting lectures from Richard M. Stallman and Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>

			<h4>What else interests me?</h4>
			<p>While I have a variety of backend and full-stack experience, there are particular things I find myself constantly fascinated by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The history and design of Operating Systems</li>
				<li>The components and interactions of Distributed Systems</li>
				<li>The operational mechanics of software architecture, how its components are interfaced with and how components work together</li>
				<li>The expressiveness of programming languages and the theories that develop them</li>
				<li>Procedurally generated things like twitter bots or roguelike dungeon levels</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I've got some non-computer-science interests, too:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm an omnivorous music nerd, both for music histories and exploring the full spectrum of musical output</li>
					<li>I don't read it as much as I used to, but I'm very into science fiction and fiction which stretches convention and boundaries</li>
					<li>My retirement dream is to open a café and work the espresso machine. I am slowly and surely getting better at pouring latté art. I roast my own coffee.</li>
					<li>I used to avidly play video games; now I mostly play and am interested in making Roguelikes
					<li>I enjoy literary and critical analysis of any media I partake in, possibly moreso than just watching/listening/reading/playing the thing itself :D</li>
					<li>I have been involved in wonderful organizations and I have been involved in hostile ones. I am always interested in how to make my regular workplace and social circles more friendly, more inclusive, and more diverse</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br />

			<div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12">
			<h4>What have I worked on professionally?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Analysis and triage of proprietary hardware's memory core dumps, to identify software defects via assembler analysis and implement fixes in code</li>
				<li>The standard library and configuration parser for a proprietary embedded operating system</li>
				<li>An automated ad campaign analysis platform that optimized Facebook advertisement campaigns using machine learning frameworks</li> 
				<li>A force.com sales/account management suite for analyzing internal customer metrics from a mobile analytics solution</li>
				<li>Requirements gathering for a variety of internal business operations, implemented via internal web applications</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			</div></div>
			<div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12">
			<h4>What have I worked on for fun?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A small collection of fun twitter bots, which include:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/CassiniNooo">CassiniBot: </a>Mourning the death of the beloved research satellite.</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/GaelanBot">GaelanBot: </a>Replicating my own twitter output via Markov Chains, plus the occasional behavioural mutation</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>One day I'll put up a photo album tracking my long and storied attempt to perfect my latté art</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Why is this page so ugly?</h4>
			<p>Perhaps you do not remember the days of DOS, or perhaps you very much remember them :D</p>
			<p>I am very much a backend developer by trade, while I read up on and appreciate the art of displaying visual information, I must be honest with myself in that I am no great visual designer and any attempts to be so would be pale imitations of my betters. If I'm going to lean on the visual designs of others, I might as well aim for something that's quirky, readable, and reflects well upon my character and the earliest moments when I fell in love with the art of computer programming.</p>
